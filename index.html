                    <strong>
                        The term "white hat" in Internet slang refers to an ethical computer hacker,
                        or a computer security expert, who specializes in penetration testing and in
                        other testing methodologies that ensures the security of an organization's
                        information systems.[1] Ethical hacking is a term meant to imply a broader
                        category than just penetration testing.[2][3] Contrasted with black hat,
                        a malicious hacker, the name comes from Western films, where heroic and
                        antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat
                        respectively.[4] While a white hat hacker hacks under good intentions
                        with permission, and a black hat hacker, most often unauthorized,
                        has malicious intent, there is a third kind known as a grey hat hacker
                        who hacks with good intentions but at times without permission

                        One of the first instances of an ethical hack being used was a "security evaluation"
                        conducted by the United States Air Force, in which the Multics operating systems was
                        tested for "potential use as a two-level (secret/top secret) system." The evaluation determined
                        that while Multics was "significantly better than other conventional systems," it also had
                        "... vulnerabilities in hardware security, software security and procedural security"
                        that could be uncovered with "a relatively low level of effort."[7] The authors performed
                        their tests under a guideline of realism, so their results would accurately represent the
                        kinds of access an intruder could potentially achieve. They performed tests involving simple
                        information-gathering exercises, as well as outright attacks upon the system that might
                        damage its integrity; both results were of interest to the target audience. There are
                        several other now unclassified reports describing ethical hacking activities within the US

                        White hat hackers use the same tools and techniques as real attackers. This can range from
                        simple public
                        “root kits” with proven tools, to complex and sophisticated campaigns involving social
                        engineering,
                        endpoint vulnerabilities, protocol spoofing, attack decoys and more. Where true black hat
                        attackers and
                        white hat hackers differ is primarily in a single way: Time.

                        White hat hackers hired to test security might have anywhere between 8 hours and a few weeks to
                        get all
                        the findings they can. Black hat attackers, however, have been known to take months, or even
                        years to
                        successfully execute campaigns. This gives attackers a major advantage: they can try dozens, or
                        hundreds
                        of different attack techniques to successfully breach networks.

                        Automating the White Hat Hacker
                        Using real attack techniques to proactively find weakness is the best and only way to truly
                        prove the
                        effectiveness of security defenses. But attackers are relentless, and have increasingly more and
                        more
                        time to successfully execute their attacks, while traditional white hat pen test are limited by
                        cost,
                        time, and staffing concerns. These limitations mean that despite the knowledge and skill of the
                        white
                        hat hackers involved, penetration tests are often limited by:

                        A limited set of techniques that can be applied in a short timeframe.
                        A primary focus only on infiltration.
                        Environment updates and changes, which make findings quickly outdated and irrelevant
                        This high cost of pen testing also means that many companies simply don’t use them, and instead
                        just
                        hope that their security controls will be effective against attack. Companies that can afford
                        penetration testing, or for whom it’s a mandatory requirement to meet compliance regulations,
                        often only
                        perform testing once a year.

                        Breach and Attack Simulation vs. White Hat Hacking
                        Today, Breach and Attack Simulation technologies are building upon the talent of white hat
                        hackers, and
                        automating their techniques. Rather than relying on a small team of humans to validate defenses
                        in a
                        short period of time, Breach and Attack Simulation executes thousands of proven attack
                        techniques at
                        scale, continuously, and automatically. In this way, enterprises can now be as relentless as
                        real
                        attackers, to truly find the “unknown unknowns” in their security architecture.

                        Unlike traditional attack techniques, Breach and Attack Simulation can also be 100% safe for
                        production
                        environments. The best solutions only run attack simulations on and between simulators, and
                        never put
                        sensitive data at risk. This way, even the most sensitive production networks can have security
                        validated continuously to stay ahead of real attackers.

                        SafeBreach uses it’s own dedicated team of white hat hackers, called SafeBreach Labs, to
                        constantly
                        build new attack techniques, and maintain thousands of proven attacks. In this way enterprises
                        can
                        harness the power of the hacker to validate their security continuously. SafeBreach weaponizes
                        the power
                        of human creativity—automated, and at scale—to stop tomorrow’s attacks, today.
